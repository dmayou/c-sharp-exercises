# Exercises for C# Practice

## Overview
These exercises are chosen to highlight the differences between dynamically typed scripting languages and compiled, staticly typed languages.

## Exercises
In each case, write a function as described. Write each in a separate file and commit it to the repository. Include table tests for each function. The tests for array functions should include an empty array, as well as null, if passed by reference.

### Exercise 1
Write a function, IsEven(), that accepts an array of integers and returns true if all the values are even. Is 0 even? What about negative values?

### Exercise 2
Write a function, DoubleValue(), that accepts an array of integers and returns a new array with each element doubled. Do not mutate the original array.

### Exercise 3
Write a function, DecrementArray(), that subtracts 1 from each element in the original array. The function has no return value.

### Exercise 4
Write a function, ReverseString(), that accepts a string and returns the string in reverse order.

### Exercise 5
Write a function, ContainsStr(), that accepts an array of strings and a string. The function returns a count of the number of array elements that contain the string.
